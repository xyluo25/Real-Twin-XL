# Real-Twin

**(Feel free to revise the document to enhance the accuracy and readability)**

ORNL’s Real-Twin project is a streamlined scenario generation tool that automatically integrates real-world traffic data to create high-fidelity digital twins for simulating the impacts of connected and automated vehicles in microsimulation environments.

## Change Log

**Change Log section will eventually be moved to CHANGLOG.md (currently maintained in README.md for development).**

### 2025-05-29

* Not create OpenDrive file if inc_sumo_net assigned in generate_inputs()
* Not create SUMO network from vertices if it exists (might take long time generating sumo network)

TODO

* Could not load / create flow data as junction attributes might changed from user and this will cause error in creating inflow data.

### 2025-05-28

* Auto selection calibration variables for turn and inflow
* Clean up input configuration file to minimize user inputs
* Format print out message for better message noticing

### 2025-02-28

#### Open Discussion

1. Calibration section, the current implementation is:
   Step 1: optimize Turn and Inflow, based on the optimized results(net, turn, flow, EdgeData, ect...)

   Step 2: perform Behavior optimization to generate results

   My question is: how can we make sure that we obtained the best reslution? Will step 2 change best results from step 1?

   As this is multi-objective optimization problem, if it's possible to perform turn and inflow optimization as objective 1, behavior optimization as objective 2 and optimize best results then?
2. Calibration fail on generated netwrokOne issue is that the generated network (abstract -> concreate -> simulation generation)  failed in calibration (I noticed that calibration section requires modified data and the generated network, such as chatt.net.xml, could not run in current stage). The generated network does not have additional files such as turn.xlsm, flow.xlsm, summary.csv ect...

   In this regard, we have to separate between part 1: (abstract -> concrete -> simulation preparation) and part 2: Calibration section.  Current implementation(TODO):  We can generate the network from part 2, but on part 2, we will use default data (not generated network) to calibrate results.  Any feedback?
