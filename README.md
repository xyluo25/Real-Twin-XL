# Real-Twin
## üîÅ Real-Twin: A Unified Simulation Scenario Generation Tool for Mobility Research

**Real-Twin** is a unified, **model-agnostic scenario generation tool** designed to streamline and standardize the evaluation of emerging mobility technologies. It provides an end-to-end framework that includes robust workflows, integrated tools, and comprehensive metrics to generate, calibrate, and benchmark microscopic traffic simulation scenarios across multiple platforms.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unified Scenario Generation**  
  Generate transferable, simulation-ready scenarios from heterogeneous data sources using a consistent workflow.

- **Automated Calibration Workflow**  
  Bridges simulation and real-world data, minimizing manual effort and making traffic simulation more accessible to researchers and engineers.

- **Model-Agnostic Compatibility**  
  Supports **SUMO**, **VISSIM**, and **AIMSUN** for cross-platform scenario generation and benchmarking. Enables reliable comparisons and reproducibility across different simulation tools.

- **Consistent Scenarios across Different Simulators**  
  Generate comparable simulation scenarios across different microscopic traffic simulators, providing users the ability to conduct benchmarking and cross-validation that are crucial for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of simulation results.

- **Emerging Technology Support**  
  Includes a scenario database and pipeline for studying **autonomous vehicles (AVs)**, with planned extensions to **CAVs**, **EVs**, and other advanced technologies.


## Installation

```python
pip install realtwin

# Or throught wheel:  download the latest wheel from github:
pip install *.whl
```


## Documentation

User guide and API documentation can be found at:

## Quick Example

```python

import realtwin as rt

# Please refer to the official documentation for more details on RealTwin preparation before running the simulation

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Step 1: Prepare your configuration file (in YAML format)
    CONFIG_FILE = "./realtwin_config.yaml"
    updated_sumo_net = r"./datasets/input_dir_dummy/updated_net/chatt.net.xml"

    # Step 2: initialize the realtwin object
    twin = rt.RealTwin(input_config_file=CONFIG_FILE, verbose=True)

    # Step 3: check simulator env: if SUMO, VISSIM, Aimsun, etc... are installed
    twin.env_setup(sel_sim=["SUMO", "VISSIM"])

    # Step 4: Create Matchup Table from SUMO network
    twin.generate_inputs(incl_sumo_net=updated_sumo_net)

    # BEFORE step 5, there are three steps to be performed:
    # 1. Prepare Traffic Demand and save it to Traffic Folder in input directory
    # 2. Prepare Control Data (Signal) and save it to Control Folder in input directory
    # 3. Manually fill in the Matchup Table in the input directory

    # Step 5: generate abstract scenario
    twin.generate_abstract_scenario()

    # AFTER step 5, Double-check the Matchup Table in the input directory to ensure it is correct.

    # Step 6: generate scenarios
    twin.generate_concrete_scenario()

    # Step 7: simulate the scenario
    twin.prepare_simulation()

    # Step 8: perform calibration, Available algorithms: GA: Genetic Algorithm, SA: Simulated Annealing, TS: Tabu Search
    twin.calibrate(sel_algo={"turn_inflow": "GA", "behavior": "GA"})

    # Step 9 (ongoing): post-process the simulation results
    twin.post_process()  # keyword arguments can be passed to specify the post-processing options

    # Step 10 (ongoing): visualize the simulation results
    twin.visualize()  # keyword arguments can be passed to specify the visualization options
```
