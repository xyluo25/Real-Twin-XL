About Real-Twin
===============

ORNL's Real-Twin project is a streamlined scenario generation tool that automatically integrates real-world traffic data to create high-fidelity digital twins for simulating the impacts of connected and automated vehicles in micro-simulation environments.

Real-Twin Framework
===================

The framework is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily generate realistic traffic scenarios by leveraging real-world data. It supports various micro-simulation platforms and is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of transportation systems, connected vehicles, and traffic management.
